# SpringRank
Using SpringRank to find layer interdependence in a multi-layered network

############## Update 1 ##################

Currently working on Synthetic Spring Rank notebook
Need to redo the test part.

Questions/notes to self : 

The beta value is too low for synthetic network
Shall we preserve the edge weights while removing edges?
